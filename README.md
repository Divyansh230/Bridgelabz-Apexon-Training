## 📘 Bridgelabz–Apexon Training Progress

### 🚀 Day 1: Git Fundamentals & Hands-on Practice
- Learned basic Git commands and understood their purpose  
- Implemented these commands on the assigned repository  
- Solved different types of merge conflicts through practical implementation  

---

## 🛠️ Day 2: Version Control Standards & Linux Basics

### 📌 Topics Covered
- Learned about **Conventional Commits** and their importance in maintaining clean and meaningful commit history.
- Understood the **Git workflow**:
  > Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
- Practiced Git and Linux commands through hands-on implementation on the assigned repository.
